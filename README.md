#Challenge1 

A > 79
B - 60 to 79
C -  59 to 49
D - 40 to 49
E - less 40


In challenge1 I used the variable score and I set any value there (50)
For any score above 79 or equal to 79 its prints letter A 
For any score above 60 or equal to 60 it prints letter B
For any score above 49 or equal to 49 it prints C 
For any score above 40 or equal to 40 it prints letter D
Anything less than 40 it prints letter E

Title used is Calculator 

Used <VAR> in order to name a variable in a mathematical expression 
Using script it embeds executable data , therefore it embeds the basic salary , House_rent , medical_allowance gross salary onto the website as the amounts are indicated 
I used prompt in order to display a dialog box that prompts the user for input therefore the basic_salary , House_rent , medical_allowances , gross_salary 
Used parseInt because it converts the arguments basic_salary , house_rent , medical_allowances to a string
